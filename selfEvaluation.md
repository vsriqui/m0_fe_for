# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

*Just like everything in this segment, we just kind of got to the tip of the iceberg. I'm confident in what I did so far, not confident that I've captured the knowledge of for statements in general.*

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

*To be honest, it kind of just drove me to go on a research bender, and I probably answered challenge 2 in a way that was silly complex. But I had a lot of fun with it.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

*I've been saving the evening after EOS reflection for reinforcing learned concepts and glancing the assignments for the next segment. So I'm probably going to just keep doing that.*

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

*I can't think of anything off the top of my head. But classmates, google, and instructors are always there!*
